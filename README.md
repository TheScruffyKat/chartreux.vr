Chartreux makes use of the [Mirror Networking](https://github.com/vis2k/Mirror) and [EOStransport](https://github.com/FakeByte/EpicOnlineTransport) packages to communicate via the [Epic Online Services](https://dev.epicgames.com/en-US/services). Chartreux.vr is designed to make developing networking for VR easy to setup in minutes

![Why Use EOS](https://github.com/TheScruffyKat/chartreux.vr/blob/main/github/WhyUseEOS.png?raw=true)

Epic Online Services (EOS) offer free and secure online multiplayer using their P2P and relay services. This means you do not need to worry abouts costs and player counts. Chartreux is not affiliated or endorsed by Epic Games and is just a package allowing easy access to EOS.
